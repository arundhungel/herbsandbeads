                    <p> Our company was established on 2008. We are primarily focused on collecting the rare herbs from different parts of Nepal including the High Himalayas and Dense Forest. We are also targeting to improvise our herb collecting and selling business to International community by providing rare genuine and authentic herb for our customers. We are dealing our product all over the world especially focusing on Chinese customers. Our store “HERBS AND BEADS STORE” is centrally located at Jytha Thamel, Kathmandu, Nepal. </p>

                    <p>It is almost impossible to purchase the rare herbs that are found in the high altitude of Himalayas. So we are trying our best to provide all kinds of rare herbs to the International Buyers located all over the world. We have recently launched our retail outlet to make our customer easier to purchase little quantity of rare herbs and we are proud to announce it as first retail outlet of Cordyceps Sinesis known as “YARSHA GUMBA”.</p>
                    <p>
                       Due to increasing demand of our customer for Rudraksha and Bodhicitta, we are also dealing different rare Rudraksha and bodhicitta beads, Rudraksha and Bodhicitta Mala. These beads are mystical and are use for meditational, medicinal and mystical benefits. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We are also dealing rare and precious gemstones stones along with the Buddhist precious and mystical Dzi stones.
